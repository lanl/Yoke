# run_yoke_study.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script navigates to a specified Yoke harness directory, sets up
#   the PYTHONPATH appropriately, and launches a Yoke training study using
#   a user-specific CSV file (hyperparameters.<USER>.csv).
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_yoke_study.sh [path_to_harness_directory]
#
#   [path_to_harness_directory] should point to a Yoke harness, e.g.:
#     /usr/projects/artimis/mpmm/wish/Yoke/applications/harnesses/ch_DDP_time_loderunner
#   If you omit the path, the script assumes the current directory is the harness.
#
#   The script will:
#     1. Verify that the harness directory exists.
#     2. Derive YOKE_ROOT by stripping everything after ‚Äú/applications‚Äù in the
#        provided path. For example, given
#        /usr/projects/artimis/mpmm/wish/Yoke/applications/harnesses/ch_DDP_time_loderunner,
#        YOKE_ROOT becomes /usr/projects/artimis/mpmm/wish/Yoke.
#     3. Export PYTHONPATH=${YOKE_ROOT}/src.
#     4. cd into the harness directory.
#     5. Look for hyperparameters.<USER>.csv in that directory.
#     6. If found, run: python START_study.py --csv hyperparameters.<USER>.csv
#     7. Otherwise, emit an error and exit.
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
#   ‚Ä¢ This script must be run under Bash.
#   ‚Ä¢ Before running, execute:
#         newgrp artimis
#     so that any generated files are group-owned by ‚Äúartimis‚Äù (otherwise
#     files will default to your personal group and not be accessible to teammates).
